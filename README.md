## Installation

This package has been tested on **x64_86** and **armhf** machines.
Pre-built packages are available for ROS Noetic on Ubuntu 20.04 (for **x64_86** and **armhf**).

### Prerequisites

- A SWD® based wheel
- Ubuntu 20.04
- ROS Noetic
- `swd-services (>= 0.1.0)`

### Ubuntu

In order to install `swd_ros_controllers`, you need to add the ez-Wheel repository to `/etc/apt/sources.list`.

```shell
echo "deb http://packages.ez-wheel.com:8081/apt-repo focal main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
```

Then download and add the GPG key using following command:

```shell
wget -qO - http://packages.ez-wheel.com:8081/archive.key | sudo apt-key add -
```

Now, you should be able to install the `ros-noetic-swd-ros-controllers` package using `apt`:

```shell
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ros-noetic-swd-ros-controllers
```

### Compiling from source

To compile the package, make sure you have added the ez-Wheel repository to your `/etc/apt/sources.list` as specified above.
Then you need to install `swd-services` using:

```shell
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt install swd-services
```

In the following instructions, replace `<rosdistro>` with the name of your ROS distro (e.g., `noetic`).

```shell
source /opt/ros/<rosdistro>/setup.bash
mkdir -p ~/ros_ws/src/
cd ~/ros_ws/src/
git clone https://github.com/ezWheelSAS/swd_ros_controllers.git
cd ..
catkin_make install
source ~/ros_ws/install/setup.bash
```

## Usage

The package comes with preconfigured `.launch` files which can be started using the `roslaunch` command:
- `swd_diff_drive_controller.launch`: sample configuration for the [SWD® Starter Kit](https://www.ez-wheel.com/en/development-kit-for-agv-and-amr) differential drive robot. To use it, run the following command:

```shell
roslaunch swd_ros_controllers swd_diff_drive_controller.launch
```

- `swd_drive_controller.launch`: A sample configuration for a single SWD® based wheel ([SWD® Core wheel](https://www.ez-wheel.com/en/safety-gear-motor) or [SWD® 150](https://www.ez-wheel.com/en/swd-150-safety-wheel-drive). To use it, run the following command:

```shell
roslaunch swd_ros_controllers swd_drive_controller.launch
```


You can always use the nodes with the `rosrun` command, the minimum required parameters are:

- For `swd_diff_drive_controller`:

```shell
rosrun swd_ros_controllers swd_diff_drive_controller \
                           _left_swd_config_file:="/path/to/swd_left.ini" \
                           _right_swd_config_file:="/path/to/swd_right.ini" \
                           _baseline:=0.485
```

- For `swd_motor_controller`:

```shell
rosrun swd_ros_controllers swd_drive_controller \
                           swd_config_file:="/path/to/swd_config_file.ini"
```

## The `swd_diff_drive_controller` node

- `wheel_safety_limited_speed_rpm` of type **`double`**: Wheel safety limited speed (SLS) (in RPM), if an SLS signal is detected (from a security LiDAR for example), the wheel will be limited internally to the configured SLS limit, the ROS controller uses this value to limit the target speed sent to the motor in the SLS case (default `30.0`).
